            </h1>

            <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
              You've sent your email campaign through BuzzConnect to thousands of Sri Lankan inboxes. The report comes back showing your open rate and unopened rate. But what do those numbers actually mean for your business — and how do you know if the campaign was worth it?
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-8">
              This guide explains exactly how to read your campaign results, how to calculate your return on investment, and how to use that information to make your next campaign even stronger.

              <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
                ROI stands for <strong>Return on Investment</strong>. It tells you how much value you got back compared to what you spent on your campaign.
              </p>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
                Email marketing consistently delivers the highest ROI of any digital marketing channel available to Sri Lankan businesses. Globally, businesses earn an average of <strong>$36–$42 back for every $1 spent</strong> on email — far ahead of social media advertising and Google paid ads.
              </p>

              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-muted-foreground space-y-2">
                <li>You provide your promotional content — an e-flyer, offer, or message</li>
                <li>BuzzConnect sends it to our verified database of <strong>500,000+ Sri Lankan contacts</strong></li>
                <li>Your campaign gets enhanced visibility on <strong>findit.lk</strong>, Sri Lanka's leading promotions and offers website, giving your campaign an additional layer of organic reach</li>
                <li>After the campaign, BuzzConnect provides you with your open rate and unopened rate report</li>
              </ul>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground mt-4">These results are your starting point for understanding how your campaign performed.</p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-foreground mb-3">Open Rate</h3>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
                Your open rate shows how many people from our database opened and viewed your email promotion.
              </p>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
                BuzzConnect always works to deliver the best possible results for every campaign. The open rate your campaign achieves depends on several factors — most importantly, the nature of your product or service and how compelling your offer is to the audience.
              </p>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-6">
                A business running a time-sensitive promotion with a strong, clear offer will naturally attract more opens than a general awareness message. This is why working with our team to craft the right message and{" "}

              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-foreground mb-3">Unopened Rate</h3>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
                The unopened rate shows the percentage of recipients who did not open the email during the campaign period.
              </p>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
                It is important to put this number in perspective. Even when a portion of the database does not open the email, the sheer scale of BuzzConnect's 500,000-contact database means thousands of real Sri Lankan people still saw your promotion — people who would never have heard about your business through a small social media post or a limited advertising budget.
              </p>

                No other direct marketing channel in Sri Lanka gives you this level of reach at this cost.

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-foreground mb-4">🧮 How to Calculate Your ROI</h2>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-6">
                With your campaign report in hand, here is a simple step-by-step process to calculate what the campaign delivered for your business.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-foreground mb-3">Step 1 — Know Your Campaign Cost</h3>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-2">This is what you invested in the BuzzConnect campaign.</p>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-6"><em>Example: Rs. 6,000 for a full database send</em></p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-foreground mb-3">Step 2 — Track Your Responses</h3>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
                In the days immediately after your campaign is sent, keep a close record of every inquiry, phone call, walk-in, website visit, or booking that comes in. This is the most important step — and the one most businesses overlook.
              </p>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-2">
                The best approach is to ask every new customer or inquiry: <strong>"How did you hear about us?"</strong> This gives you a direct link between the campaign and your results.
              </p>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-6"><em>Example: A restaurant in Colombo ran a lunch promotion and received 85 new table bookings in the week following the campaign.</em></p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-foreground mb-3">Step 3 — Calculate Revenue Generated</h3>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-2">Multiply the number of responses by the average value of each customer.</p>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-6"><em>Example: 85 bookings × average spend of Rs. 2,500 = Rs. 212,500 in revenue</em></p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-foreground mb-3">Step 4 — Apply the ROI Formula</h3>
              <div className="bg-primary/10 border border-primary/20 rounded-xl p-6 mb-4">
                <p className="text-foreground font-semibold mb-3 text-center">
                  ROI (%) = [(Revenue – Campaign Cost) ÷ Campaign Cost] × 100
                </p>
                <p className="text-muted-foreground text-center mb-2">
                  ROI = [(Rs. 212,500 – Rs. 6,000) ÷ Rs. 6,000] × 100
                </p>
                <p className="text-accent font-bold text-center text-lg">ROI = 3,442%</p>
              </div>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                For every Rs. 100 spent on the campaign, this business earned Rs. 3,542 back.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-foreground mb-4">🎯 Results Depend on Your Product and Offer</h2>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
                One of the most important things to understand about email marketing ROI is that your results are directly connected to what you are promoting and how you present it.

              <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-6">
                BuzzConnect delivers your campaign to the right audience with the best possible reach. But the response your campaign generates is driven by the strength of your offer. Here is what consistently produces the best results for Sri Lankan businesses:

                  <p className="text-muted-foreground text-sm">
                    Campaigns with a clear benefit — a genuine discount, a limited-time package, a free consultation, an exclusive deal — always outperform vague messages.

                Every BuzzConnect campaign also includes enhanced visibility on <strong>findit.lk</strong> — Sri Lanka's most popular platform for promotions, offers, and discounts, with over <strong>200,000 monthly visitors</strong>.
              </p>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
                This means your promotion does not only reach people through their inbox. It is also listed on a platform Sri Lankan consumers actively visit when they are searching for deals. Findit.lk ranks on Google's first page for searches like <em>"offers in Sri Lanka," "promotions in Sri Lanka,"</em> and <em>"discounts in Sri Lanka"</em> — meaning your campaign continues to attract new customers through organic search long after the email has been delivered.
              </p>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                This combination of direct email reach and ongoing online visibility is what makes BuzzConnect campaigns more powerful than a standard email blast. You are getting <strong>two channels working for your business at the same time</strong>.

                    Your promotion is listed on findit.lk, which ranks on Google's first page for high-traffic searches like "offers in Sri Lanka" and "promotions in Sri Lanka." This gives your campaign ongoing visibility beyond the email send, reaching consumers who are actively searching for deals online.
