              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-foreground mb-4">What is Direct Marketing?</h2>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
                Direct marketing is a strategy where businesses communicate directly with a targeted audience — without going through traditional media like TV, newspapers, or billboards. Instead of broadcasting to everyone and hoping the right people see it, you send your message directly to the people most likely to buy.
              </p>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
                The key advantage: you control who receives your message, when they receive it, and on which platform. You can measure every result — who opened it, who clicked, and who converted.
              </p>

              <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
                The most effective campaigns do not rely on a single channel. Combining email, SMS, and WhatsApp in a single coordinated campaign dramatically increases reach and response rates because your audience encounters your message across multiple touchpoints.

              <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
                A hotel running email only reaches inbox users. Adding SMS reaches people who missed the email. Adding{" "}

              <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
                Direct marketing is one of the most cost-effective marketing strategies available to Sri Lankan businesses. Unlike Google Ads where you pay per click or TV ads where you pay per second, direct marketing lets you reach thousands of verified contacts for a predictable, manageable cost.
              </p>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                Costs depend on the channel chosen, audience size, campaign complexity, and frequency. Email campaigns are typically the most affordable entry point, while full multi-channel campaigns offer the highest reach and ROI.

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-foreground mb-2">Is direct marketing suitable for small businesses in Sri Lanka?</h3>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
                Yes. Direct marketing is especially powerful for small and medium businesses because it lets you compete with larger companies on a focused, measurable budget. A well-targeted email or SMS campaign delivers results far beyond its cost.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-foreground mb-2">How quickly can I see results from a direct marketing campaign?</h3>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
                Results are typically visible within 24 to 72 hours of sending. Email campaigns show open rates within the first few hours. SMS campaigns often generate calls and enquiries within minutes of delivery.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-foreground mb-2">Can I target specific industries or locations in Sri Lanka?</h3>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                Yes. Buzz Connect's database is segmented by industry, location, job title, and consumer behaviour for precise targeting.
